## 2025-01-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TrendWeight has been rebuilt as a modern web application focusing on weight trend analysis through smart scale integrations. The product targets individuals tracking weight changes who want to see true trends rather than daily fluctuations. Key features include automatic sync with Withings and Fitbit scales, exponentially weighted moving average calculations, and optional public profile sharing.

### Context

The original TrendWeight was a legacy C# MVC application that needed modernization. The rebuild maintains the core value proposition while updating the technology stack and improving the user experience. The decision to rebuild rather than refactor was driven by the need for better maintainability, modern UI/UX, and improved performance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Incremental Refactoring**
   - Pros: Less risky, maintains service continuity
   - Cons: Technical debt would remain, limited UI improvements possible

2. **Mobile-First Native Apps**
   - Pros: Better mobile experience, platform-specific features
   - Cons: Higher development cost, fragmented codebase

### Rationale

A complete rebuild with modern web technologies was chosen to provide the best long-term foundation while maintaining the ability to serve all platforms through a responsive web app.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, maintainable codebase
- Improved performance and user experience
- Better testing and deployment practices

**Negative:**
- Migration complexity for existing users
- Temporary feature parity gap during transition

## 2024-12-01: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected React + TypeScript + Vite for frontend and ASP.NET Core 9.0 for backend, with Supabase as the database and authentication provider.

### Context

The technology stack needed to balance developer productivity, performance, and long-term maintainability. The team has strong experience with both React and C#/.NET.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Next.js Full-Stack**
   - Pros: Single language (TypeScript), integrated SSR
   - Cons: Less familiar to team, concerns about vendor lock-in

2. **Vue.js + Node.js**
   - Pros: Lightweight, good ecosystem
   - Cons: Team lacks Vue experience, would require training

### Rationale

The chosen stack leverages existing team expertise while using modern, well-supported technologies. Supabase provides excellent PostgreSQL hosting with built-in auth, reducing infrastructure complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development with familiar tools
- Strong typing throughout the stack
- Excellent tooling and ecosystem support

**Negative:**
- Two languages to maintain (TypeScript and C#)
- Potential complexity in local development setup

## 2024-11-15: Data Storage Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Backend Developer

### Decision

Store weight measurements with local date/time strings rather than Unix timestamps, and use JSONB columns for flexible data storage.

### Context

Weight measurements from different providers come in different formats. Withings provides UTC timestamps with timezone info, while Fitbit provides local time. Users care about when they weighed themselves in their local time, not UTC.

### Rationale

Storing local date/time preserves the user's context and simplifies display logic. JSONB provides flexibility for provider-specific data without constant schema migrations.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simpler frontend display logic
- Preserves user's temporal context
- Flexible data model for future providers

**Negative:**
- Cannot easily query across timezones
- Slightly larger storage footprint

## 2025-01-24: Agent OS Integration

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Agent OS for structured AI-assisted development workflow, retrofitting it to the existing TrendWeight codebase.

### Context

As the product grows, maintaining consistent development practices and documentation becomes crucial. Agent OS provides a structured approach to feature planning and implementation that works well with AI coding assistants.

### Rationale

Agent OS will help maintain development velocity while ensuring proper documentation and planning for new features, particularly important for the upcoming legacy migration enhancements.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured approach to feature development
- Better documentation for AI assistants
- Consistent planning and implementation process

**Negative:**
- Additional process overhead
- Learning curve for Agent OS workflows

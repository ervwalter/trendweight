## Pitch

TrendWeight is a web application that helps people understand their weight trends over time by providing moving averages and trend analysis, allowing them to focus on long-term progress rather than daily fluctuations caused by water retention and other factors.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Weight Loss Community**: Individuals actively trying to lose weight who want to track progress without getting discouraged by daily fluctuations
- **Health-Conscious Individuals**: People monitoring their weight for health reasons who need reliable trend data

### User Personas

**Weight Loss Tracker** (25-55 years old)
- **Role:** Individual on a weight loss journey
- **Context:** Using diet and exercise to lose weight gradually
- **Pain Points:** Daily weight fluctuations are discouraging, hard to see real progress
- **Goals:** See true weight trend, stay motivated by focusing on long-term progress

**Health Monitor** (30-65 years old)
- **Role:** Health-conscious individual maintaining or monitoring weight
- **Context:** Regular weighing as part of health routine
- **Pain Points:** Difficult to identify concerning trends vs normal variation
- **Goals:** Early detection of weight trends, maintain healthy weight range

## The Problem

### Daily Weight Fluctuations

Weight can vary by several pounds day-to-day due to water retention, sodium intake, and other factors. This makes it difficult to see if you're actually making progress toward your goals.

**Our Solution:** Calculate moving averages to show the true trend line.

### Manual Data Entry Fatigue

Manually logging weight every day is tedious and easy to forget. This leads to incomplete data that makes trend analysis less accurate.

**Our Solution:** Automatic sync with Withings and Fitbit smart scales.

## Differentiators

### Automatic Smart Scale Integration

Unlike manual tracking apps, we automatically sync data from Withings and Fitbit scales. This results in complete, accurate data without daily manual entry.

### Mathematical Trend Analysis

Unlike simple weight trackers that just plot points, we use exponentially weighted moving averages. This results in clear visualization of actual weight trends versus daily noise.
